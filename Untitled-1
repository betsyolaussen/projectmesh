      <h1>WHY THINK ABOUT IT?</h1>
    </div>

        <p>
            The use of technology and the role it plays in my relationships is something I find increasingly 
            important to think about. Beginning during my undergraduate years in the Art program at the 
            University of Wisconsin- Eau Claire, I have been making art about technology as a way to discuss
            and process how I feel technology impacts, both positively and negatively, my relationships and 
            other human interactions I see in my communities. <br><br>
            Technology has advanced immensely in the last two hundred years, and personal-scale technology has 
            advanced quite rapidly in the last thirty or so years. This has been personal computers, smartphones, 
            watches, smart homes, classroom technology, and of course larger scale technological advances that 
            impact medicine, travel, science, and military, which I focus on less in my work. As the presence of 
            technology continues to build, the need to consider how technology interacts with and impacts our 
            human society becomes more imperative. <br><br>
            In my work thus far, including Project MESH, I consider and discuss the presence and impact of technology 
            on small scale interpersonal interactions-- the relationship with the self, with other individuals, or with 
            small groups or communities. Technology can facilitate the building, deepening, or maintaining of 
            interpersonal relationships, which is something we are all aware of at this point. However, it can also 
            create distance, a feeling of absence, or even alienation in our relationships, both those we forge in 
            person or online. I want to create a space where folks can discuss and share work about both the positive 
            and negative outcomes of technology’s presence in our relationships, but I think it is particularly 
            important to make space to think intentionally and discuss openly the way that technology sometimes hinders 
            our ability to feel connected or present with one another.

          During my undergraduate art program, I focused a lot on identity and how technology plays a role in 
          forming our physical identities, not just our online identities. Over the course of my Masters program 
          at MCAD, I have shifted my focus towards how the overuse of technology impacts our relationships, 
          both with ourselves in shaping our identities, and our relationships with others. <br><br>

          When I began creating MESH, I really wanted the name of the project to have roots in technology itself, 
          and technology’s relationship to humans. I began thinking about how humans network with each other, and 
          also the idea of computer networking. It struck me that this network pattern exists in many places. 
          The massive and completely invisible infrastructure of wireless networking really fascinates me, so I 
          started investigating recent advancements in wireless networking. One such advancement is the mesh wireless 
          network. A mesh network is a network of wireless routers that create a highly reliable connection for a 
          large area, like an entire home or office space. Companies like Eero and Google, among others, are producing 
          and selling these mesh network setups to consumers. This type of wireless network intrigued me because it 
          seemed to mirror, or actualize, the same pattern that human networks have. Our relationships and communities 
          are built on these webs of connectedness.

    Project MESH is a space to build community and dialogue around the topic of humans’ relationship
          to technology. I hope to highlight and deepen the benefits of technology in our relationships
          and encourage awareness and mindfulness of the drawbacks, in order to ultimately strengthen our
          relationships with each other, as humans. Moving forward, I hope to produce more volumes of
          the MESH zine, encourage more people to submit work and join the conversation, and eventually
          use the ideas behind Project MESH to create an in-person interactive installation.
