      <h1>WHY THINK ABOUT IT?</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The use of technology and the role it plays in my relationships is something I find increasingly 
            important to think about. Beginning during my undergraduate years in the Art program at the 
            University of Wisconsin- Eau Claire, I have been making art about technology as a way to discuss
            and process how I feel technology impacts, both positively and negatively, my relationships and 
            other human interactions I see in my communities. <br><br>
            Technology has advanced immensely in the last two hundred years, and personal-scale technology has 
            advanced quite rapidly in the last thirty or so years. This has been personal computers, smartphones, 
            watches, smart homes, classroom technology, and of course larger scale technological advances that 
            impact medicine, travel, science, and military, which I focus on less in my work. As the presence of 
            technology continues to build, the need to consider how technology interacts with and impacts our 
            human society becomes more imperative. <br><br>
            In my work thus far, including Project MESH, I consider and discuss the presence and impact of technology 
            on small scale interpersonal interactions-- the relationship with the self, with other individuals, or with 
            small groups or communities. Technology can facilitate the building, deepening, or maintaining of 
            interpersonal relationships, which is something we are all aware of at this point. However, it can also 
            create distance, a feeling of absence, or even alienation in our relationships, both those we forge in 
            person or online. I want to create a space where folks can discuss and share work about both the positive 
            and negative outcomes of technology’s presence in our relationships, but I think it is particularly 
            important to make space to think intentionally and discuss openly the way that technology sometimes hinders 
            our ability to feel connected or present with one another.

    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
          From the start I knew this topic mattered to me and has for quite some time. 
          As I prepared to produce project Mesh, I did a lot of reading to understand the broader 
          conversation taking place about humans and technology to understand where my 
          interest and opinions fit into the larger discourse. Reading people's work like 
          Jia Tolentino’s <i>Trick Mirror</i>, Jenny Odell’s <i>How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy</i>, 
          and Sherry Turkle’s <i>Alone Together : Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from 
          Each Other</i> was very informative to me because of their ideas about identity and attention span. 
          I also spent time looking at other zine publications to understand what design strategies are being 
          used in the zine community today and what kind of zine content is out there. I looked at Selkie Zine 
          and All Black Zine and learned how to use creative expression to engage a community.
